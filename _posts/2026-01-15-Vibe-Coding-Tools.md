## Lovable

* [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) - AI coding assistant for developers.

### Pre-requisites:

* If you are technical and want to have more control of the supabase cloud that lovable uses under the hood make sure to create a free supabase account [here](https://supabase.com/). Then link it to lovable when you sign up. Otherwise you will need to do a migration later which can be a bit tedious.
* Other advantages is you have more auth options whereas lovable only exposes google auth.

### Migrating Lovable supabase project to your own supabase account
