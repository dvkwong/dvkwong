# 3d Printers

I purchased the [Bambu Labs P1S with AMS](https://store.bambulab.com/products/p1s) in Dec 2023 for approx $1500 NZD and it is awesome!

Bambulabs also sells the very capable [A series](https://store.bambulab.com/collections/a1-series) range starting at $199 USD!

> Bambulabs unfortunately does not have direct shipping to NZ. [Mindkits](https://www.mindkits.co.nz/Bambu-Lab.aspx) is the NZ supplier and prices are a little higher due to GST / freight etc. 

PBTech also sells 3d printers eg [Creality FDM 3D Printer](https://www.pbtech.co.nz/product/PTRCRL0011/Creality-FDM-3D-Printer-K1C-Build-Size-220-x-220-x?qr=rec-view) - $1089 NZD 24/08/2024
